**Funcationality 1: high contrast mode**
Pressing the button on the top right side of the screen that reads: "Turn on high contrast mode" Should trigger this javascript effect. This effect should set the background of the site as well as the nav header to a darker variation of their default colors. Pressing the button again should reset those colors.

**Functionality 2: hover effects on images**
Pressing the second button on the top right of the screen that reads: "add hover effects to images" should trigger this javascript effect. Now, when users hover over an image it should enlarge, and when they move thier mouse away it should return to its original size. When the user clicks the button again this effect will be turned off.
