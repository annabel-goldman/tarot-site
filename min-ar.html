    <h2 class="minor-section"> <a name="Cups"> Cups</a></h2>
    <p> The Suit of Cups is tied to the element of Water and delves into the realm of emotions, intuition, and relationships. These cards speak of love, compassion, joy, sorrow, and the subtle currents of feeling that shape our experiences. Cups reveal how we connect to others and to ourselves on an emotional level, exploring intimacy, empathy, and the depths of the subconscious. They can signify romance, friendship, artistic expression, and spiritual insight. However, they also warn of emotional overwhelm, illusions, or escapism. Ultimately, the Suit of Cups invites us to honor our feelings and navigate the ebb and flow of the heart’s tides.</p>

    <h2 class="minor-section"> <a name="Wands"> Wands</a></h2>
    <p> The Suit of Wands pulses with vibrant energy and symbolizes the element of Fire. It’s associated with creativity, inspiration, and the spark of ambition that drives us to pursue our goals. Wands often appear in readings when we’re starting new ventures, exploring ideas, or feeling the urge to take bold action. They can represent enthusiasm, courage, and the desire to make things happen, but they can also hint at impatience, impulsiveness, or burning out too quickly. In essence, the Wands capture the passionate, restless side of human nature—the force that pushes us to grow, create, and transform our lives.</p>

    <h2 class="minor-section"> <a name="Swords"> Swords</a></h2>
    <p> Ruled by the element of Air, the Suit of Swords is the domain of the intellect, truth, and communication. Swords represent our thoughts, beliefs, and the mental challenges we face. They’re associated with logic, clarity, decision-making, and sometimes conflict or struggle. Swords cut through confusion and demand honesty, even when the truth is uncomfortable. These cards can signal tension, arguments, anxiety, or the need to stand up for justice. Yet they also bring insight, breakthroughs, and mental fortitude. The Suit of Swords reminds us that while the mind is powerful, it must be wielded wisely to avoid harm—both to ourselves and others.</p>


    <h2 class="minor-section"> <a name="Pentacles"> Pentacles</a></h2>
    <p> The Suit of Pentacles embodies the element of Earth and deals with the material and physical aspects of life. It concerns money, career, health, home, and the tangible rewards of effort and skill. Pentacles are about building security, stability, and practical success. They reflect hard work, resourcefulness, and our connection to nature and the physical world. While often linked to wealth and prosperity, Pentacles also touch on themes of generosity, sustainability, and how we value our resources. Challenges in this suit can signal financial stress, stagnation, or neglecting one’s physical or material needs. At its core, the Suit of Pentacles urges us to cultivate balance between material pursuits and deeper fulfillment.</p>
